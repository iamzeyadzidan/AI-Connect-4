# AI Connect 4
Simple connect 4 game

- This assignment was issued by CSE351, Artificial Intelligence course staff in November 2022.

- Problem statement: Design a connect-four game such that a player can play against an AI agent.
    The AI agent shall use minimax algorithms with and without pruning.
    Given a maximum depth, whenever that depth is reached, the AI should use a heuristic to determine the value of the game.
    
- The game supports Player vs AI Agent and AI Agent vs AI Agent modes.
- The code is as efficient as possible:
    - Handles the board in a bit-representation model.
    - Each file (tried to apply OOP concepts here) does a job.
    - Efficient use of storage and speed.
- The AIs can use 2 heuristics rather than just one.
